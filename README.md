 A map of pedestian and bicycle collisions with motor vehicles in the city of Toronto.

This is a hexmap using turf.js and Mapbox API to show the density of collisions between pedestrians/cyclists and motor vehicles around Toronto. Each hex can be clicked to show the number of collisions in its 0.5km area. 

This code also contains symbology for the individual points and the bounding box that were used to produce the hexagons. While this data has been commented out, it could easily be readded back to the map and modified, however this was beyond the scope of my tasks.

Data has been edited from https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-involving-killed-or-seriously-injured-persons/
